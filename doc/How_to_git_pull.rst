		How to Git Pull


1.	Enter  into the github directory you have in your machine or create one
		
			cd github (...to enter the directory)
		or
			mkdir github (...to create a github directory).

2.	Enter the repository of which you want to update (“git pull”); for example 
	using “cloudmesh" as a repository:

			cd cloudmesh

	Note: this is done if this repository is already available in your machine, else
	you will have to clone the repository from the github site by:
	
			git clone “https.....”

3.	Now type in “git pull” into the command line:

			git pull
	
	...and the work is done!
